

Goal: Create instant, error-reduced side-by-side comparisons from filings, KPIs, and (optionally) web data.
Build for
Data Ingestion: Accept company PDFs/HTML (10-K/10-Q), research notes, and CSV KPIs
Entity/KPI Alignment: Normalize company names, map metric synonyms (e.g., “Adj. EBITDA”)
Comparator/Aligner: Line up like-for-like metrics across years/companies
Report Composer: Generate a structured comparison table and concise highlight callouts
Web Enricher: Pull 1–2 public metrics if available; cache to avoid rate limits
Demo expectations: Load 2–3 companies with mixed sources → show a clean comparison table with highlights (e.g., revenue, profit, growth deltas, margin diffs) → export/share as CSV/HTML

Build Architecture

1. Data Ingestion (Input Layer)

Accept:

PDFs/HTML (10-K, 10-Q) → parse via pdfplumber or PyPDF2

CSV uploads with KPIs

Pasted text (research notes)

Normalize into plain text blocks for AI.

Entity/KPI Alignment (Standardizer)

Normalize company names (e.g., “Apple Inc.” → “Apple”).

Synonym mapper for metrics:

Adj. EBITDA → EBITDA

Net Income → Net Profit

Operating Revenue → Revenue

Quick hack: Maintain a dictionary mapping synonyms → standard KPIs in Python.

Comparator / Aligner (Engine)

AI (OpenAI GPT) extracts structured metrics like below:

{
  "Company": "Apple",
  "Year": 2023,
  "Revenue": 394.3,
  "Net Profit": 99.8,
  "EBITDA Margin": 32,
  "Debt": 85.2,
  "Cash Reserves": 62.1
}


Align by year & KPI → generate side-by-side table.

Report Composer (Frontend Output)

Clean comparison table (Company A vs B vs C).

Highlights section:

“Apple has 25% higher revenue growth vs Microsoft.”

“Amazon’s debt-to-equity ratio is riskier.”

Export as CSV or HTML report.

(Optional) Web Enricher

Pull 1–2 public metrics (market cap, PE ratio) using Yahoo Finance API or AlphaVantage.

Cache results (dict or SQLite) → avoids rate limits.

Landing page:

	2 liner about what is the app about (product info)
	message that says, "want to get insights and financial comparison of companies using cutting edge technology? Hit 'Start' below."
	a button that will take user to comparison page

Comparison page:

	has provision to upload financial documents for 2 to 4 companies (in pdf/html format)
	has provision to enter company names manually or if not entered manually, name should be picked from document uploaded.
	validates for doc format
	upon hitting compare button, 
		documents are analysed for compatibility (whethere data belongs to same year/quarter), whether data is of same nature (financial results etc), if not show error
		documents are analysed using ai agent for key metrics to be used for comparison. get all key info from documents extacted into json format.
